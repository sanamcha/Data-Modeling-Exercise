# Data-Modeling-Exercise

Data modeling schema design exercises
Part 1: Schema Design
Code Review

After completing these schemas, be sure to chat with your mentor and ask for a code review.

Part One: Medical Center
Design the schema for a medical center.

A medical center employs several doctors
A doctors can see many patients
A patient can be seen by many doctors
During a visit, a patient may be diagnosed to have one or more diseases.
Part Two: Craigslist
Design a schema for Craigslist! Your schema should keep track of the following

The region of the craigslist post (San Francisco, Atlanta, Seattle, etc)
Users and preferred region
Posts: contains title, text, the user who has posted, the location of the posting, the region of the posting
Categories that each post belongs to
Part Three: Soccer League
Design a schema for a simple sports league. Your schema should keep track of

All of the teams in the league
All of the goals scored by every player for each game
All of the players in the league and their corresponding teams
All of the referees who have been part of each game
All of the matches played between teams
All of the start and end dates for season that a league has
The standings/rankings of each team in the league (This doesn’t have to be its own table if the data can be captured somehow).
Part 2: Schema Critique
We’ve provided you with a handful of SQL files that will create some databases and populate them with some data. Run each of the seed files and take a look at the data that’s generated. Next, think about how you could improve the schema. Finally, modify the original seed files based on your updated schema!
